# COGS-118B-Project

COGS 118B was focused on the mathematical derivation and Python implementation of unsupervised machine learning models. Our group aimed to categorize different audio files into their respective genres based on either their audio (wav file) or spectrogram properties. To implement this approach a hand-written Principal Component Analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data / spectrogram images, and K-Means clustering was followed to attempt to cluster each song into a genre. Looking at the results and our write-up, itâ€™s obvious that these methods did not produce accurate results, but the complexities and methods of unsupervised models became much clearer. Hopefully in the future this project can be improved even more.
